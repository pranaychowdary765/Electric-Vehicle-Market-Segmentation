Project Overview:
This project analyzes the electric vehicle (EV) market using clustering techniques to identify market segments and valued EV models. It evaluates key attributes such as price, range,           powertrain type, and customer behavior to provide actionable insights for businesses and consumers.

Key Objectives:
      Market Segmentation: Categorize EVs based on price, range, and speed.
      Customer Analysis: Explore how demographic and financial factors influence EV choices.
      Valued EV Identification: Select EV models that cater to specific customer needs.
      
Methodology:
      Data Exploration & Cleaning: Cleaned data for attributes like price, range, and powertrain type to ensure accuracy.
      Visualization: Used scatter plots, line charts, and bar plots to identify trends in EV pricing, range, and performance.
      
Clustering:
      K-Means: Grouped EVs into segments such as economy, mid-range, and premium.
      K-Prototypes: Segmented customers based on age, salary, loan dependency, and dependents.
      Behavioral Insights: Linked customer behavior with EV preferences to align market offerings.
      
Key Findings:
      Budget-friendly EVs appeal to younger buyers and families with dependents.
      Premium EVs attract high-income customers.
      A strong correlation exists between EV price, range, and demographic factors like age and salary.

Conclusion:
      This project provides a comprehensive understanding of the EV market and helps businesses target their offerings to specific customer segments effectively.
